## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial. The issue we were addressing was to come up with an interactive system with enhanced security features

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
One thing I did well was the focus on analyzing the appropriate security vulnerabilities we needed to target on. For example, cryptography would be a security point to focus on for all transactions. It is important to code securely to ensure both company data and user data are protected from hacking attempts. This could reinforce the confidence from both sides. Once data is secured, company would be more confident in advertising its service, and users would trust the company and adhere to it.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the assessment is to incorporate all available information from the source code and the company's current situation to provide an appropriate analysis and potentially forsee upcoming threats

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, address as many vulnerabilities as possible. When assessing specific vulnerabilities, I would make sure the appropriate data is being reviewed and then utilize the best-fitting tools to establish enhanced security

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Software development is a long process, and it cannot be done through procrastination. Therefore, developing the base code first would be an ideal situation to ensure functionalities are established, and then adding security measures without massive modifications of the base code. The vulnerability check tool would be very helpful, though having a risk of posting false positives, to ensure the overall source code is secured

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The vulnerability check tool would be very helpful and easy-to-use as a dependency added to a maven project

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I will show my skills of analyzing vulnerabilities based on the given information, as well as ways to enhance security features based on the analyzed vulnerablilities
